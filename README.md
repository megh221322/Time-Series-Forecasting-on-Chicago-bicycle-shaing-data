# Time-Series-Forecasting-on-Chicago-bicycle-sharing-data
This Project shows the performance of ARIMA, VAR and PROPHET Time series models on the Chicago Divvy Bicycle Data taken from Amazon S3 bucket. Data is preprocessed, and Mutual Information scores are calculated to identify the prediction's key features and model. Ride_duration and average_speed are curated to increase the model's accuracy.
