# Time-Series-Forecasting-on-Chicago-bicycle-sharing-data
This Project shows the performance of ARIMA, VAR, and PROPHET Time series models on the Chicago Divvy Bicycle Data taken from the Amazon S3 bucket sourced at  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. Data is preprocessed, and Mutual Information scores are calculated to identify the key features, model, and type of task. Ride duration and average speed are curated to increase the model's accuracy.
